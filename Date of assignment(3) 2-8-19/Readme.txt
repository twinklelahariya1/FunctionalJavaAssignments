Collections Assignment

Create a console application to showcase multiple Library. 
(It would be fine for now to create an application that receives input from console and displays results on console)

Multiple Libraries : Each Library will have Multiple Albums under it.
Multiple Albums  : Each  Album will have Multiple Songs
Multiple Songs : Each Song will have details like : Author, Date of Release, Movie Name

Input should be taken based on index number stated beside the entity. Example : 
00)  All  
01)  Library-1
02)  Library-2  
03)  Library-3 

On selection of '03', Albums under the 'Library-3' should be shown in a similar list format.
Similarly for Albums and Songs.

Finally when a list of song is populated as 
00)  All   
01)  Song-1
02)  Song-2  
03)  Song-3 

Let's say Final input is '02', information like 
-Author
-Date of Release
-Movie Name
should be shown on the console.
